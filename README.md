## 1) Git for Beginners


### 1.1 What is version control?

Answer: Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

--> It helps developers to  manage changes to source code over time.

--> It helps software teams work faster and smarter on Developement.

--> VCS keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of databasesoftware teams work faster and smarter.

--> It helps to Organise distrubuted code in best manners.

### 1.2 What is git?

Answer: Git (/ɡɪt/) is a distributed version control system: tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).
Git was originally authored by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel, with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer. As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike most client–server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a full-fledged repository with complete history and full version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under the GPL-2.0-only license.

### 1.3 Why we should use git?

Answer: Git provides Performance / Security / Flexibility.

--> Performance : Git provides commiting, branching, merging and comparing past versions are all optimized for performance.

--> Security :  The content of the files as well as the true relationships between files and directories, versions, tags and commits, all of these objects in the Git repository are secured with a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA1. This protects the code and the change history against both accidental and malicious change and ensures that the history is fully traceable.

--> Flexibility : Git is flexible in several respects: in support for various kinds of nonlinear development workflows, in its efficiency in both small and large projects and in its compatibility with many existing systems and protocols.

### 1.4 Installation of Git.

Answer:  
You probably have Git installed already — try typing at the command line and see if it returns a version number. If it says the command is not found, use your package manager to install it move to next step.
```bash
git --version
```

If you are using a RedHat style, distribution (RedHat, CentOS or Fedora),
```bash
sudo yum -y install git
```
or on the newer distributions
```bash
sudo dnf -y install git
```
